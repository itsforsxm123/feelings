# Project Checklist

This document tracks progress across each phase of the Emotion Hierarchy Explorer project. This should be kept up to date.

## Phase 0: Pre-Development Foundations

### 1. Develop Comprehensive Emotion Hierarchy Dataset
- [ ] Research existing emotion models and hierarchies
- [ ] Define primary emotions to include
- [ ] Define secondary emotions linked to each primary emotion
- [ ] Define limited set of tertiary emotions for deeper exploration
- [ ] Document relationships between emotion levels
- [ ] Create JSON structure for the emotion hierarchy
- [ ] Validate structure with sample data
- [ ] Document the data structure for future reference

### 2. Create Initial Wireframes and User Flow Diagrams
- [ ] Define key user journeys through the application
- [ ] Create wireframes for primary emotion selection screen
- [ ] Create wireframes for secondary emotion exploration screen
- [ ] Create wireframes for tertiary emotion deep dive screen
- [ ] Document user flow between screens
- [ ] Consider and note accessibility requirements for each screen
- [ ] Review wireframes against user needs and goals
- [ ] Gather initial feedback on wireframes from potential users

## Phase 1: Building the Prototype

### 3. Set Up Development Environment
- [ ] Initialize Git repository
- [ ] Set up project using Create-React-App or Vite
- [ ] Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- [ ] Install base dependencies (React)
- [ ] Install Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Select and install UI component library
- [ ] Configure folder structure
- [ ] Add README with setup instructions
- [ ] Make initial commit

### 4. Implement Emotion Hierarchy Data Loading
- [ ] Import JSON emotion data into React application
- [ ] Set up basic state management with React Context
- [ ] Create utility functions for data access
- [ ] Implement error handling for data loading
- [ ] Write unit tests for data loading
- [ ] Document the data loading process
- [ ] Ensure data is accessible to UI components

### 5. Build Basic Frontend Structure & Primary Emotion Selection Interface
- [ ] Create layout components (header, main content, footer)
- [ ] Implement primary emotion selection grid/buttons
- [ ] Enable selection of 1-2 primary emotions
- [ ] Style components using Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Ensure keyboard navigation works
- [ ] Implement proper semantic HTML
- [ ] Add basic animations/transitions for selections
- [ ] Test interface on different screen sizes
- [ ] Write unit tests for key components
- [ ] Document component structure and props

## Next Steps After Phase 1

### 6. Conduct Initial User Research/Feedback
- [ ] Create a research plan
- [ ] Recruit 3-5 potential users for feedback
- [ ] Prepare demonstration or prototype for testing
- [ ] Document feedback methodology
- [ ] Conduct user testing sessions
- [ ] Analyze and document findings
- [ ] Identify priority improvements based on feedback
- [ ] Create action items for Phase 2 development

### 7. Iterate on Initial Prototype
- [ ] Refine UI based on user feedback
- [ ] Improve interaction patterns
- [ ] Fix any identified issues
- [ ] Enhance accessibility features
- [ ] Expand test coverage
- [ ] Document changes and rationale
- [ ] Update wireframes if significant changes are made

### 8. Plan for MVP
- [ ] Define MVP feature set
- [ ] Create development tasks for secondary/tertiary exploration
- [ ] Plan visualization components
- [ ] Determine responsive design approach
- [ ] Evaluate state management needs and select solution
- [ ] Consider backend requirements
- [ ] Create timeline for MVP development
- [ ] Assign priorities to features
- [ ] Document technical decisions and architecture
- [ ] Establish version control workflow and branching strategy

## Quality Assurance Checks (Apply to All Phases)

### Accessibility (A11y)
- [ ] Ensure proper semantic HTML throughout
- [ ] Verify keyboard navigation works for all interactive elements
- [ ] Check color contrast meets WCAG standards
- [ ] Add appropriate ARIA attributes where needed
- [ ] Test with screen readers
- [ ] Document any accessibility decisions or compromises

### Code Quality
- [ ] Follow consistent coding standards
- [ ] Review and refactor code regularly
- [ ] Maintain test coverage for new features
- [ ] Document complex logic
- [ ] Perform code reviews before merging
- [ ] Keep dependencies updated
- [ ] Check for performance issues

### Project Management
- [ ] Update this checklist regularly
- [ ] Track progress on tasks
- [ ] Document decisions and changes
- [ ] Manage technical debt
- [ ] Communicate blockers and challenges
- [ ] Regularly evaluate timeline and adjust as needed
